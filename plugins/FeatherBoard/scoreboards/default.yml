# Default FeatherBoard comes with a board called "default". All players have the permission
# featherboard.group.default  (by default) meaning all players should see the scoreboard unless
# the permission is negated.

# Example of the use of settings
# This section is optional
settings:
  # If you quickly want to change the
  # the label color change it here.
  # It replaces $setting_label-color$ throughout the entire config
  label-color: "&5"
  # Show or hide the health
  # This is an example of the script
  show-health: true
  # The priority of the scoreboard. The higher the number -> higher priority
  # Used when having more than one scoreboard assigned
  priority: 10

# Example of pre processing script
# This section is optional

# This section is required. Those are your scoreboard lines
lines:
  # Every section here are different lines. The first section will be used as the title
  # the following sections will be used as the lines on the scoreboard (max 15)
  # Just as the scoreboard names you can name these 'lines' whatever you want. But to make
  # things simple I will use logical names such as "title", "spacer", "header", ...
  title:
    # Every line has its own frames. The animation will loop through these frames on intervals
    # that you configure below.
    # Put all your frames under 'text:'. You can make as many lines as you want and use
    # placeholders and preset effects.
    # Keep in mind that there is a limit in line width!
